"""Coloring function are mapping truncated orbits to the real line.
The number of elements N+1 in the argument of u is variable. The coloring u(O_T(z0)) is often studied as a function of the point z0,
whereas certain coloring functions only use the last iterate z_N of O_T(z0). This is denoted u(z_N) in the docstrings.
